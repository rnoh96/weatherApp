# WeatherApp
A website I've built to demonstrate my skills on writing clean and efficient HTML, CSS, Javascript code, as well as knowledge on API

  

## Lessons Learned
I had really fun time reviewing my study materials from school and doing some more research on "fetch", which is a Promise function. Even though I leanred Promise back in school, I didn't really get many chance to actually use it in a project.

  

## Potential Future Features
- Get user's current location with navigation.geolocation in order to initially display the weather data of the city that the user is located

- Display different background image depending on searched city's weather condition

- Weather forecasts


## Deployment
Deployed with Google Firebase.

## Get Started
From command line, first clone this repo:
```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/rnoh96/weatherApp.git

# Go into the repository
$ cd weatherApp

# Go into the public folder
$ cd public
```

Once you are in the correct folder:
``` bash
# Open the html file in default browser
$ open index.html
```

You should now see a working webpage.
